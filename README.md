This is a test project, which was completed in April 2024 to evaluate my abilities.
You can start exploring it from the Gamebootstrapper class.

Test conditions:
The player controls the character who needs to get out of the maze.

There are enemies in the labyrinth who begin to pursue the player if he appears in the zone of their direct sight. With a loss of visibility, the persecution is ceasing. Enemies can stand motionless or patrol between several points. 

If the enemy overtakes the player -
An attempt to pass the labyrinth is considered failed, a level restart is taking place. 

A fixed time is released to pass the level. If the player does not have time to go through the labyrinth in the allotted time, he loses. 

The player wins if he reaches the exit from the maze.

In UI, display the number of the current attempt to pass the level and a level timer,
Messages about victory and defeat.

Implement the ability to save and upload a saved game. 1 Servation slot is enough.

During the game, you should be able to open the menu. When opening the menu, the game is paused. In the menu, place the buttons save and upload the game.

3D, the camera is located on the top at an angle and follows the player.
The target platform is mobile.

The test task evaluates the software implementation (project architecture, mechanics). 
The level and characters can be collected from primitives, visual design is not evaluated.

The result is to provide a link to the repository.
